        <li>
          <b>Against Pakistan:</b> Under the leadership of Rawat, the Indian
          Army has taken some of the most stringent steps against Pakistan. It
          was under his tenure that the army provided stronger defences along
          the border with Pakistan, when the Indian Air Force carried out the
          Balakot strikes in February 2019.

        <li>
          <b>Myanmar Strike:</b> He was instrumental in reducing the militancy
          in the Northeast, with one of the highlights of his career being the
          2015 cross-border operation into Myanmar in which the Indian Army
          successfully responded to an ambush by NSCN-K militants.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>UN Mission:</b> When Bipin Rawat took charge of the United Nations’
          North Kivu Brigade in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2008, things
          weren’t going too well for the world’s costliest peacekeeping mission,
          known by its French acronym MONUC.
